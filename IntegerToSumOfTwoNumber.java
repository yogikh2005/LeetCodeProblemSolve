/*No-Zero integer is a positive integer that does not contain any 0 in its decimal representation.

Given an integer n, return a list of two integers [a, b] where:

a and b are No-Zero integers.
a + b = n
The test cases are generated so that there is at least one valid solution. If there are many valid solutions, you can return any of them.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 2
Output: [1,1]
Explanation: Let a = 1 and b = 1.
Both a and b are no-zero integers, and a + b = 2 = n.
Example 2:

Input: n = 11
Output: [2,9]
Explanation: Let a = 2 and b = 9.
Both a and b are no-zero integers, and a + b = 11 = n.
Note that there are other valid answers as [8, 3] that can be accepted.
 

Constraints:

2 <= n <= 104*/

class Solution {
    public int[] getNoZeroIntegers(int n) {
        for (int a = 1; a < n; a++) {
            int b = n - a;
            if (isNoZero(a) && isNoZero(b)) {
                return new int[]{a, b};
            }
        }
        return new int[]{}; 
    }

    private boolean isNoZero(int num) {
        return String.valueOf(num).indexOf('0') == -1;
    }
}
